SF2Forms
========

This is an Forms-Extension for Symfony2

The goal is to keep all Form-Related data in the view and to have a unified way to create them.

Also I wanted the optiion to switch, edit or recreate every Formfield without refactoring my old code.

This is an initial release and not the "real" thing - I'm working on a much better Version - but if someone stumbles upon this and wantÂ´s to help you are very welcome.

At this time I want to create different formfields for Bootstrap3 - But the beauty in this solution is that it is compatible with every other CSS Framework.
